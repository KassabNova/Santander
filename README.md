## Building

You will need Android Studio with API level 27, Visual Studio 2017+ with ASP .NET 2.2 packages, and SQL Server 2016 Express.
All  the scripts necessary for the database are in the folder `SQL Scripts`: just execute the Create scripts and the Insert ones so you have the test data.

`You should make the necessary adjustments in the WS to the database connection and also the connection from the app to the WS.`
- The phone app is pointing to the IP address where we hosted our web service: it should point to your localhost or address hosting the WS.
- The WS has the user and password hardcoded, you should probably change that to your own DB instance.

# Database

I used SQL Server 2016 Express and SQL Server Management Studio 2017.
